# Article Dog

By using newspaper3k library, this program should -is on progress- take a bunch of article webs given by the user to display it. 

# What Im learning

Using PyQt5 Signals, Threads.
As for newspaper3k... is pretty magical as the way to use: give url, and ask for the data.
I also want to achieve a nice UI, but thats for later.
